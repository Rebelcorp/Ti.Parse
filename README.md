Ti.ParseJS
========

Fork of the official Javascript Parse.com SDK for Appcelerator Titanium

Works partly. It is possible to login with Facebook using the native Ti Facebook module on iOS. Retreiving, saving of Objects, Queries and Cloud functions work as well...

*Still very much work in progress!*
